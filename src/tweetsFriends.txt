TODAY, THE SWELLING WENT DOWN, BUT I HAVE A CONSTANT INNER EAR PAIN AND SOME BRUISING ON THE OUTSIDE paracetamol
;;;;;;
I ENDED UP DROPPING 30 LBS OFLOXACIN  BECAUSE THE TRISMUS FROM INFECTION WAS SO BAD I COULDN’T EVEN OPEN MY MOUTH
;;;;;;
PRETTY NORMAL WITH EXCESS AMOUNTS OF ZESTRIL, EVEN STANDARD AMOUNTS SOMETIMES YOU CAN GET A BIT OF TRISMUS
;;;;;;
EVEN WITHOUT clindamycin, I STILL CAN'T FEEL AS nervous SENDING HIM HOME AS YOU DO
;;;;;;
:(POOR KIDDO IS COVERED IN A RASH FROM THE AMOXICILLIN
;;;;;;
I TOLD THE URGENT CARE DOC TO GIVE ME AZITHROMYCIN BECAUSE I KNEW I WAS GOING TO GET VERTIGO
;;;;;;
Once I had a middle ear infection so I took azithromycin. It healed the infection but the nausea was a very uncomfortable feeling.
;;;;;;
When I had a pain in my chest the doctor diagnosed it as pneumonia and ordered me to take amoxicillin. Rash appeared on my skin and lasted 10 days long.
;;;;;;
All my live I always had headaches. I tried a lot of medications, but paracetamol only helped me. Finally, I can live.
;;;;;;
Last week I had flu and fever. My doctor gave me Azithromycin and i felt worst! After, I had back pain and i couldn't sleep
;;;;;;
amoxicillin is awesome! I had flu, headache, fever and after week's with it is ok!
;;;;;;
doxycycline helped me with my back ache and chest pain
;;;;;;
Ear pain, headache and problem with sleeping... Why?! I used ciprofloxacin
;;;;;;
clindamycin is awesome! It helped me with ma ear aches. 
;;;;;;
Two week's with cold, but now is better. metronidazole helped me with my bacterial infection

I ate something in Thai, I had huge diarrhea, but fortunately is trimethoprim!
;;;;;;
I am using zestril for over 1 month and I haven't got any of below issues, however sometimes I have diarrhea but not stomachache. Neither headache. ??
;;;;;;
I was sick and taking ciprofloxacin helped a lot. Sometimes my head was exploding, but i get rid of HIV so I recommend that seller.

When I get bored I am sniffing some crushed ofloxacin. I have never had such a vagina itching.
;;;;;;
Taking a metronidazole caused me a huge headache. 
;;;;;;
After two hourse when I took azithromycin I had to vomit all my lunch.
;;;;;;
Sometimes when I run out of insuline I am eating a Snickers. However when I take hydrocodone I have to eat 20 of them.
;;;;;;
Last christmas when I ate a lot I had a flatulance. Taking a doxycycline provided me to release all I got. After 2 days the diarrhea stopped.
;;;;;;
This medicine (azithromycin) caused such a urinal infection that I had never experinced. Even the Rome standing on the road didn't infected me in such scale.
;;;;;;
When I get borred I am sniffing some crushed ofloxacin. I have never had such a vagina itching.
;;;;;;
My kid after taking zestril had enormous spasm of his left leg.
;;;;;;
Ciprofloxacin is great to play with a girls in a dark park. It causing nervous system disorder so you can do anything you want!
;;;;;;
Probably amoxicillin caused a whiteheads on the face of my teenager son.
;;;;;;
This is shit! This (clindamycin) had done nothing instead of logginess of my son with ADHD.
;;;;;;
having taken zestrill made me feel cold, I started freezing at night.
;;;;;;

;;;;;;
due to paracetamol i felt ok but the side effects were headache, hassle and flux.
;;;;;;
after ciprofloxacin I had several times vagina burns and and hurtig. Moreover I had penetrating feeling.
;;;;;;
Azithromycin cause disorders of my nervous system. I started to have mental disorders and problems with sleep.
;;;;;;
doxcycline will make your vagina hurt and cause cramps and spasms eventually.
;;;;;;
I was taking clindamycin for for years. In the beginning it helped but then I had horrible toilet problems and back pains. My ass ached a lot and was stinking. 
;;;;;;
Metronidazole helped me in the firt phase. Unfortunately after the recovery I used to suffer from vaginal inflammation , dysentry and hardship. My vagina was stiff.
;;;;;;
I was taking trimethoprim which made me feel strong headache and caused low level of insulin and even dissiness
;;;;;;
Because of this shitty zestril i began to vomit every day
;;;;;;
When I took metronidazole for the first time I was having discomfort in my stomach.
;;;;;;
After my amoxicillin treatment I was having diarrhea
;;;;;;
I'm always tired when I take ciprofloxacin
;;;;;;
I have stomach discomfort after taking paracetamol tablets
;;;;;;
Azitromycin causes candidiasis of my vagina
;;;;;;
Trimethoprim is my least favourite drug, I'm having chest pain after taking it
;;;;;;
Hypotension is one of my problems when I take amoxicillin
;;;;;;
Doxycline makes me puke a lot
;;;;;;
azithromycin i had headache and only headache
;;;;;;
Taking Cipro for too long can cause some vaginal inflammation . I dont like it too much. Additionally I have a red skin everywhere. 
;;;;;;
when I took Vitapap I had very big headache and also had to vomit for 5 minutes
;;;;;;
hmm, taking qbrelis several years and nothing happens. Sometimes maybe I have a little bit distress
;;;;;;
While taking zohydro the I had a very high blood pressure . But maybe it isnt the problem
;;;;;;
I love adoxa I have no drug reactions
;;;;;;
Why metronidazole gives me a discomfort and mental disorder??
;;;;;;
While taking metronidazole my reactions were diarrhoea, urinal infection, headache, discomfort and distress
;;;;;;
I dont know if I will take this medicine. It gives me headache. :(
;;;;;;
After some drugs with proquin I had a great diarrhoea . nausea I dont know what to do. Someone help?
;;;;;;
When I started to take Doxycycline, it's much better know. Maybe sometimes a small rash.
;;;;;;
I eat zmax and I'm sure I have a headache . It's always because of this drug.
;;;;;;
After Zestril there is a big dizziness. And I think I also have a nervous system disorder .... A little insomnia too.
;;;;;;
My doctor recommended me vitapap . Till now the only drug reaction I have is that I have to vomit . Maybe I'm a little bit anxious too.
;;;;;;
I was prescribed the medicine Trimethoprim and I have to say I have my glucose low in blood :/.
;;;;;;
pain is the worst I ever had. I take the medicines zestril and proquin :) just doesnt work at all.
;;;;;;
Why everyone is telling only positives? What about the dizziness and diarrhea?
;;;;;;
Hey, Im new here, but I cant complain about anything, I take floxin and it is ok.
;;;;;;
This is not good everything :( Paracetamol is normally ok, but I fell like a lot of discomfort and distress...
;;;;;;
A little bit cephalalgia after taking Moxatag nothing more :)
;;;;;;
I had vomit like for 5 days but apart from that Zmax is a good medicine!
;;;;;;
I was at the doctor and he prescriped me Morgidox, because I had a bacterial infection. 
;;;;;;
Very hard nausea :/ Because of what? of course of hydrocodone!
;;;;;;
Clindamycin: the worst thing were of course the exfoliation and erythema...
;;;;;;
Moxatag causes a lot of good things. Maybe apart from the fact that I was very anxious.
;;;;;;
Before my visit at the dentist I took the Aspirin for a week. He had to extract my teeth. The bleeding was so intense!
;;;;;;
My headache was so intense when I were on the pills. Now I don't take it and it's so great filling.
;;;;;;
I had to take thw fluconazole once. I had really bad diarrhoea and I didn't going out for 3 days.
;;;;;;
I use metronidazol last time. I forgot that drinking alcohol after this drug is prohibited. My stomach hurt so much.
;;;;;;
My doctor recipe tetraciclin for my son when he was 8. Now he's teeth are destroyed.
;;;;;;
After using azithromycin my diarrhea has stopped but I got a strong headache.
;;;;;;
Metronidazole caused a minor morning sickness but other than that it was ok.
;;;;;;
I took ofloxacin and felt like vomiting.
;;;;;;
Hydrocodone made me sleepy but helped with the back pain.
;;;;;;
Ciprofloxacin prvided me only with mental disorder, depression and ear aches.
;;;;;;
Zestril didn't help me with my headache but helped me with my dandruff.
;;;;;;
Paracetamol is the best way to fight your stinging but I got also insulin reaction after it.
;;;;;;
I had a huge problem with asthenopia but clindamycin helped. Unfortunately it also left me with vaginal inflammation.
;;;;;;
After using amoxicillin for my sunburn I got fecal impacion.

Not only clindamycin gave me skin rash but also cramps. Howether, it helped with my puking.
;;;;;;

;;;;;;
 have been consuming azithromycin for some time my family noticed in my place depressive state, nervousness and outbursts of anger…
;;;;;;
I take trimethoprim and I have a drama I can't sleep !!!!

From the time I take metronidazole and chest pains started to ache.
;;;;;;
I have ringworm on hands after taking ciprofloxacin, is it bad?
;;;;;;
My head hurts even more after paracetamol, bleah.
;;;;;;
Hydrocodone helps but cramps after are terrible.
;;;;;;
Do you want to throw up because of trimethoprim like I?
;;;;;;
Don't take azitromycin, toilet problems so big!
;;;;;;
I hate clindamycin, I feel like I get flu.
;;;;;;
