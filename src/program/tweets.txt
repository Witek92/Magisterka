When I started to take Doxycycline, it's much better know. Maybe sometimes a small rash.

I eat Alodox and I'm sure I have a cold . It's always because of this drug.

After Zestril there is a big dizziness. And I think I also have a nervous system disorder .... A little insomnia too.

My doctor recommended me vitapap . Till now the only drug reaction I have is that I have to vomit . Maybe I'm a little bit anxious too.
